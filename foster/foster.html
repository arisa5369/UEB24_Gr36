        <p>
          Petfinder depends on foster parents to save lives. By fostering, you offer a pet a second chance—and gain a rewarding experience in return. 
          We’re a judgment-free, supportive community for both pets and humans, welcoming fosters who communicate openly and work toward timely adoptions, 
          helping us create space for more pets.

              “I’ve been a volunteer and foster parent for Petfinder pet Rescue since
              2013. I could do this at many other rescues, but I love Petfinder
              because I’ve always felt like part of a family there. The support I get
              is amazing. And Petfinder’s mission of prioritizing pets with special
              needs is especially close to my heart. I have fostered many cats who
              were blind or missing limbs and several who needed hospice care. Hospice
              fostering has been particularly rewarding for me. Ensuring that the last
              chapter of a cat’s life is as happy and comfortable as possible is so
              important, and Petfinder makes sure that these deserving pets have
              everything they could possibly need. Thank you, Petfinder, for always
              giving cats the lives they deserve.”
